"""Download files the user shares in Teams and hand them to the Copilot SDK.

When a user attaches a file, Teams sends a ``message`` activity with an
attachment of type ``application/vnd.microsoft.teams.file.download.info`` whose
``content.downloadUrl`` is a pre-authenticated URL. We download the **raw
bytes** to a per-conversation folder under ``$HOME`` and hand the file *path*
straight to the model as an attachment — we do **no** parsing/extraction, so any
file type (PDF, PPTX, images, spreadsheets, code, …) is the model's to read and
reason over using its own tools.
